After operation is complete, the TKNEN bit is set to '000', and the CMPIRQ bit of the Interrupt USB Host Register (INTR_USBHOST) is set to '1'. The settings of the TGGL and ENDPT bits are ignored when sending a SOF token. Notes: - This bit is set to the default value when the RST bit of the Host Control 1 Register (HOST_CTL1) is set to '1'. - The PRE packet isn't supported. - Do not set '100' to the TKNEN bit when the SOFBUSY bit of the Host Status Register (HOST_STATUS) is '1' - Mode should be USB Host before writing data to this bit. - When issuing a token again after the token interrupt flag (CMPIRQ) has been set to '1', wait for 3 cycles or more after a USB transfer clock (12 MHz in the full-speed mode, 1.5 MHz in the low-speed mode) was output, then write data to this bit. - Read the value of TKNEN bit if a new value is written in it .Continue writing in this bit until a retrieved value equals a new value written in. During this checking process, it is needed to prevent any interrupt. - Take the following steps when CMPIRQ bit of Interrupt USB Host Register (INTR_USBHOST) is set to '1' by finishing IN token or Isochronous IN token. 1. Read HS bit of Host Error Status Register (HOST_ERR), then set CMPIRQ bit to '0'. 2. Set EPn bit of Host DMA Enable Register (HOST_DMA_ENBL) (n=1 or 2) to '1' if HS bit of Host Error Status Register (HOST_ERR) is equal to '00' and wait until EPn bit of Host DMA Data Request Register (HOST_DMA_DREQ) changes to '1'. Finish the IN token processing if HS bit is not equal to '00'. 3. Read the received data if EPn bit of Host DMA Data Requet (HOST_DMA_DREQ) (n=1 or 2) changes to '1'."
