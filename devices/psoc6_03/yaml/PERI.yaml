      description: "Clock divider enable command (mutually exclusive with DISABLE). Typically, SW sets this field to '1' to enable a divider and HW sets this field to '0' to indicate that divider enabling has completed. When a divider is enabled, its integer and fractional (if present) counters are initialized to '0'. If a divider is to be re-enabled using different integer and fractional divider values, the SW should follow these steps: 0: Disable the divider using the DIV_CMD.DISABLE field. 1: Configure the divider's DIV_XXX_CTL register. 2: Enable the divider using the DIV_CMD_ENABLE field. The DIV_SEL and TYPE_SEL fields specify which divider is to be enabled. The enabled divider may be phase aligned to either 'clk_peri' (typical usage) or to ANY enabled divider. The PA_DIV_SEL and PA_TYPE_SEL fields specify the reference divider. The HW sets the ENABLE field to '0' when the enabling is performed and the HW set the DIV_XXX_CTL.EN field of the divider to '1' when the enabling is performed. Note that enabling with phase alignment to a low frequency divider takes time. E.g. To align to a divider that generates a clock of 'clk_peri'/n (with n being the integer divider value INT_DIV+1), up to n cycles may be required to perform alignment. Phase alignment to 'clk_peri' takes affect immediately. SW can set this field to '0' during phase alignment to abort the enabling process."
