    - name: START
      description: "FW sets this field to '1' to start a program operation. HW sets this field to '0' to indicate that the operation has completed. Note: it is good practice to verify the result of a program operation by reading back a programmed eFUSE memory location. Programming can only change an eFUSE memory bit from '0' to '1'; i.e. a programming operation is a 'one-off' operation for each eFUSE memory bit: once a bit is changed to '1', it can NEVER be changed back to '0' as a hardware fuse is blown. Programming a memory bit to '1' requires blowing a fuse and requires an eFUSE macro operation. Therefore, this programmiong operation takes time (as specified by the SEQ_PROGRAM_CTL reguisters). Programming amemory bit to '0' does not require an eFUSE macro operation (it is the default eFUSE macro state). Therefore, this programming operation is almost instantaneous. Note: during a program operation, a read operation can not be performed. An AHB-Lite read transfer to the eFUSE memory during a program operation results in an AHB-Lite bus error."
