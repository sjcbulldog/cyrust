    - name: SW_RST_ALL
      description: "Software Reset For All This reset affects the entire Host Controller except for the card detection circuit. During its initialization, the Host Driver sets this bit to 1 to reset the Host Controller. All registers are reset except the capabilities register. If this bit is set to 1, the Host Driver must issue reset command and reinitialize the card. Values: - 0x0 (FALSE): Work - 0x1 (TRUE): Reset"

Host Controller can continue data transfer even after this reset is executed while handling subcommand-response errors. The following registers and bits are cleared by this bit: - Present State register - Command Inhibit (CMD) bit - Normal Interrupt Status register - Command Complete bit - Error Interrupt Status - Response error statuses related to Command Inhibit (CMD) bit Values: - 0x0 (FALSE): Work - 0x1 (TRUE): Reset"
