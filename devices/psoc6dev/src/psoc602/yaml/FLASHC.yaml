The erroneous data is NOT placed in a bus master interface's cache and/or buffer. This field is ONLY used by CPU bus transfers. Non-CPU bus transfers always have a bus transfer with a bus error, in case of a non-recoverable error. Note: All CPU bus masters have dedicated status registers (CM0_STATUS and CM4_STATUS) to register the occurrence of FLASH macro work interface internal errors (non-correctable ECC errors and memory hole errors are NOT registered). Note: fault reporting can be used to identify the error that occurred: - FLASH macro work interface internal error. - FLASH macro work interface non-recoverable ECC error. - FLASH macro work interface recoverable ECC error. - FLASH macro work interface memory hole error."
